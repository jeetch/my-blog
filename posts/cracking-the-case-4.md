#### Problem Statement :

They have a new CEO who has promised to double their revenue while keeping margins same over the next 4 years. Their current revenue is $5.4B. They want recommendations on how they can realize this goal.

#### Takeaways :
- Sound friendly during the case, try to make jokes and sound excited about the case eg. 'Souds like a sweet case!', 'Name of the game is growth!'
- Talk through the math you are doing so that it can be corrected by the interviewer if needed
- Clarifying questions should be around business problem and business model
- Have fun!
