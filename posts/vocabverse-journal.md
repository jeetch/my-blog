Hello Everyone!

I'm embarking on a journey to take the GRE, which has inspired me to develop an app called VocabVerse.

Inspirations: I've drawn inspiration from platforms like Threads' homepage, Obsidian, and the Word of the Day app.

Competitors: One notable competitor is Magoosh.

My aim is to create a fun and engaging app for vocabulary learning!

I've decided to document my VocabVerse journey here:

11/09: Today, I focused on WordNet. Opting for larger NLP models seemed like overkill for this task. I believe the success of this product will hinge on its user experience. The goal is to meld Obsidian's graph view with a user-focused learning experience, utilizing modern AI applications.

11/10: Had an enlightening conversation with two fellow builders during a talk. One is developing a multilingual MBA program app using open-source materials, and the other is working on a crypto-based health records system for privacy-concerned doctors. The latter, though a bit complex and proprietary, was particularly intriguing. One of them uses Obsidian, which aligns well with my project. It's time to get cracking on the demo.

11/11: Watched this insightful video: [Link to Steve's Video on Builder.io]. It reinforced my belief in using AI judiciously â€“ it's crucial to distinguish my product from something that could be generically created by OpenAI. It's not just about feeding data into a black box; it's about creating something unique and tailored.

11/12: Completed the first week's update!

11/14: Reflecting on the relatively slow progress last week, I'm keen to follow a tutorial and start building more rigorously. React-force graph seems like the right choice. Also, inspired by the Word of the Day app, I plan to incorporate beautiful visuals using Stability AI. Need to explore how Backdrop can aid in this.
