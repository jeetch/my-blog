Ahh Python, I have missed you dearly! I saw this hackathon recently on Devpost and am really excited to be a build something with streamlit now. What a time it is to be a developer with ideas and some time on your hands. (Google also announced Gemini AI hackathon!)

So let's get into it : The idea is to build an app to take your eureka moment one step further and give you an app name, subtitle, basic business idea and maybe a color template suggestion. I plan to use this app then for developing my other ideas for other hackathons ðŸ˜†

This is going to be a quick build so stay tuned..
