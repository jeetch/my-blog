**Background:**

Ahh Python, I have missed you dearly! I saw this hackathon recently on Devpost and am really excited to be a build something with streamlit now. What a time it is to be a developer with ideas and some time on your hands. (Google also announced Gemini AI hackathon!)

So let's get into it : The idea is to build an app to take your eureka moment one step further and give you an app name, subtitle, basic business idea and maybe a color template suggestion. I plan to use this app then for developing my other ideas for other hackathons 😆

Update: 05-22-2024

I completed my build in the last 2 days. It is a simple wrapper app around the snowflake arctic model built on stremlit but it was fun making another hackathon project at the last minute. I got some more ideas to work on while building this so gonna focus on some more builds in the coming days. But here i the final product and the devpost page with my project!

**Tech Stack:**

- Streamlit
- Snowflake-arctic through Replicate API
- Python
