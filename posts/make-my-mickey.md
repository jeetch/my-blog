So the idea with this project was to generate free images of steamboat willie. I have tried training a SDXL model using copyright free images of mickey mouse on replicate for this. Also this will be the first project where I test out implimenting Stripe payments

Still WIP updates soon!

Can you summarize this guide to make an iconic cartoon mouse face for a graphic designer so that he can create this face. Your instruction should be in one paragraph and the output when given to an image generator should output the mouse

Make this original character from the description and make it exact to the description : To capture the iconic cartoon mouse, start with a large, precise, bold black circle for the head. Directly atop, touching the head's boundary, situate two equally sized bold black circles for the ears to form a well-known silhouette. Within the facial area, place two oval eyes high on the face, each with a white sclera and a black pupil, ensuring they are level and radiate an affable persona. Below the eyes, center a small, rounded nose that points down, with a bold black outline. The nose's base should nestle the top of a broad, charming smile that spans the breadth of the face, its contours outlined clearly in black. This smile should curl upward, expressing jubilance, without any whiskers to maintain the character‚Äôs traditional look. Complete the facial features with a tongue gently curving within the mouth. It‚Äôs critical that the ears remain wholly black, with no internal detailing, to preserve the signature style. Make certain the head retains a full circular shape, without distortion, and the smile is free of teeth. This detailed account should enable the creation of the legendary cartoon mouse with its timeless appeal.
