This case study was discussed as a part of the Strategy& pre-MBA program. It was an interesting discussion where the emphasized on the importance of not only solving the case in a structured way but also that out-of-the-box thinking and solutions will always be rewarded and it is what they are looking for! I have some interesting takeaways from this case at the end. The case also involved a lot of estimation and the consultants emphasized on the need to be comfortable with market sizing.


#### Problem Statement :
The client is the CEO of a newly established public transport entity in a major city in the Middle East. They are responsible for developing and operating the first intra-city metro service. Your team is tasked to assess the feasibility of such project.

#### Takeaways :
- Rephrase the problem statement in the start of the case, but only the essential parts so that you know you are clear
- Always clarify Points of confusion, it is completely fine 
- Talk through the analysis and calculations before doing any math, always proceed once the interviewer is aligned 
- State all the assumptions wherever possible
- Creative thinking is essential and what will set you apart. Think outside the box while giving solutions and  offer several solutions
