Compilation of Joshcodes Tips:

 - Use pnpm its much faster and takes lesser space than npm 
 - Set `emmet balance:outwards` as `ctrl+M` to select the whole html inside a tag use
 - `LShift ctrl + P` when auto import doesnt work and select developer reload window, should work 90% of the time
 - `shift alt arrow down` - copy the same line of code below
 - Select a word  and then press  `Command âŒ˜ + D`  as many times as you need. This adds a cursor on the the same wor (if it exists) selected which every press of  `Cmd + D`  and will allow you to change that specific word in al places at the same time. Pretty neat!
