**Background: 🌟**

Made my first own production website as a personal project on Next : GPT Prompts Project.  
The idea was to create a simple and user-friendly website that would showcase the creativity and diversity of ChatGPT prompts. Anyone can submit a prompt on the website (after creating an account) and others can browse through them. You can also "favorite" the prompts you like the most and see your own favorites list.
