Have been a little lazy lately but trying to pickup practicing some case studies now that we have 2 months to the start of my MBA! This was a Mckinsey case study from management consulted. It was an interesting case about a potential iced coffee launch by a top 5 beverage comapny. The difference than other 2 cases I have done so far is that this was very interviewee driven!

#### Problem Statement :
BeverageCo is a top 5 beverage company in the US who have their own marketing and sales and have their own supply chain. They have 10 bottling plants and existing agreements with retailers for their other products. They want to launch PowerUp, a new packaged ice coffee brand. It will have 5 flavors one of which will be low sugar. Their objective is to make $4M in profits in the second year. They want you to tell what will be the important factors in this launch and if they have the capabilities to launch this product?
